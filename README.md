# What Could Go Wrong - Online Communities Edition

This repository is the home for the resources needed for the « What « Could Go Wrong - Online Community version » online game. Originally crafted by Nikolas Martelaro and Wendy Ju, the game debuted at the AutoUI 2020 Workshop. It underwent transformations under Nik and his collective at CMU, evolving to encompass AI-centric scenarios. The current iteration diverges significantly, shedding light on the dynamics of online communities.

In this version, the game delves into the vast universe of online social structures, leveraging prompts that explore the intricacies of virtual interactions and community governance. Inspiration for scenarios comes from a blend of theoretical research and real-world examples, including findings from Smith et al. (2024) and insights from VirtualSocietyHub.com. The framework for discussing potential social and ethical implications is informed by the Digital Society Ethics Code (Diaz & Patel, 2023) and principles of online community management (Jensen & Harper, 2022).

This iteration is enriched with a versatile LaTeX template, enabling enthusiasts to bring the game into the physical realm from its digital origins. Players can immerse themselves in "Community Constellations" through PlayingCards.io, where the game thrives with options for customizing decks through provided csv files for prompts and responses, allowing for a tailored exploration of online communities' complexities.

The digital card game can be loaded into and played on PlayingCards.io. Custom cards can be added using the `csv` files for `prompts` and `responses`

## Abstract
While autonomous vehicles have the potential to greatly improve our daily lives, there are also challenges and potential downsides to these systems. In this workshop, we intend to foster discussions about the potential negative aspects of autonomous cars in hopes of surfacing challenges that should be considered during the design process rather than after deployment. We will spur these conversations through a review of participant position statements and through group discussion facilitated by a card game called “What Could Go Wrong?” Our goal is to consider the autonomous vehicle’s benefits—improving safety, increasing mobility, reducing emissions—against potential drawbacks. By identifying potential harms and downsides, the workshop attendees, and the AutoUI community more broadly can design well-considered solutions.

## Game Setup Instructions
1. Download this repository
2. Go to https://playingcards.io/game/standard-deck to start a custom deck
3. Enter the virtual card table
4. Click the `Edit Table` icon in the green toolbard
5. Select `Room Options`
6. Select  `Import From File`
7. Upload `what-could-go-worng-av.pcio`
8. Click `Edit Table` to exit editing mode and go into gameplay mode

## Gameplay Instructions
1. Players draw 5 white cards.
2. Use the spinner to select the Card Czar.
3. The Card Czar draws a black prompt card and reads it aloud.
4. Players place a white response card face down.
5. The Card Czar reads each response aloud.
6. Instead of selecting the preferred answer, the Card Czar tries to guess who played which card, adding a playful and engaging twist. This rule encourages the Card Czar to justify their choices, enhancing memory and engagement with the game's content.
7. Discussion ensues, and points are awarded not only for the selected card but for insightful contributions to the conversation.
8. The role of Card Czar rotates, and play continues.

### During the game
1. Take notes on ideas that you have not thought about before
2. Some of the cards are causes, others are effects. Don’t worry about what the game designers intended with each card, go where the discussion is best.
3. Some of the cards may be upsetting. (Such as, a person is abused.)
4. Engage in discussions, even on challenging topics.
5. Stay on track but allow for meaningful digressions.
